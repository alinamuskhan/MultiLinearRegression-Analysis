# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project focuses on developing and analyzing a multiple linear regression model to understand how multiple independent variables influence a target variable and evaluate model accuracy.

## Project Overview
Multiple linear regression models the relationship between one dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is used for predictive analytics in fields like finance, marketing, and engineering.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and documentation environment

## Techniques and Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load and understand dataset structure
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Encode categorical variables
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Analyze correlations for feature selection

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Select/transform features for better performance
- Remove multicollinearity by checking correlations

### 4. Model Building and Training
- Implement and train the multiple linear regression model

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate performance using MSE, RMSE, and R-squared
- Interpret coefficients to understand variable influence

## Conclusion
The model provides insights into predictor relationships, and evaluation metrics help assess its performance. Future improvements include feature engineering, model optimization, and cross-validation.
